# ADR-002: Database Selection

## Context
The system requires a robust and scalable database to store user profiles, portfolio data, and theme configurations.

## Decision
The database will be **MySQL**.

## Rationale
- **Relational Database**: Ideal for structured data with relationships (e.g., user-portfolio association).
- **Open Source**: No licensing costs, making it cost-effective for development and production.
- **Wide Adoption**: MySQL is widely used and supported, ensuring availability of resources and community support.
- **Performance**: Excellent for handling read-heavy workloads and supports various optimization strategies.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - Reliable for transactional data and ACID compliance.
    - Strong community and ecosystem support, including tools for backup, migration, and monitoring.
- **Negative**:
    - May require more configuration for complex queries compared to some NoSQL databases.

## Status
Approved.

## Next Steps
1. Set up MySQL in the development environment.
2. Define database schemas for users, portfolios, and themes.
3. Optimize database queries for performance.
