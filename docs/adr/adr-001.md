#ADR-001: Backend Framework for API Development
##Context
The backend of the Portfolio Management System requires a reliable and scalable framework to manage APIs, handle authentication and authorization, and perform database operations efficiently.

##Decision
The backend will be developed using Spring Boot.

##Rationale
1. Java Expertise: Spring Boot aligns with the team's existing expertise in Java.
2. Rapid Development: Provides a streamlined way to build REST APIs with minimal boilerplate.
3. Scalability: Supports microservices architecture, allowing the system to scale efficiently.
4. Built-In Features: Includes support for security (Spring Security) and database integrations (JPA/Hibernate).
5. Community Support: A large ecosystem of plugins and an active community ensure long-term viability.

##Consequences
###Positive:
- Reduces development time with pre-configured modules.
Easy integration with authentication systems like OAuth2 and JWT.
###Negative:
- Requires knowledge of Spring ecosystem (learning curve for new developers).

##Status
Approved.

##Next Steps
Set up a Spring Boot project structure.
Configure essential libraries (Spring Security, Hibernate).
Develop base APIs for user and portfolio management.
