#ADR-003: Authentication and Authorization
##Context
User roles (portfolio owner vs. visitor) and secure access are central to the system's functionality.

##Decision
Authentication will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and authorization will be role-based.

##Rationale
1. **JWT**:
- Secure and stateless, suitable for REST APIs.
- Easily integrates with Spring Security.
2. **Role-Based Authorization**:
- Simplifies access control by assigning roles (e.g., owner, visitor).
3. **Scalability**: Stateless JWT tokens reduce server load.
##Consequences
###Positive:
- Highly scalable authentication mechanism.
- Easy integration with frontend and mobile apps.
###Negative:
- JWT requires secure storage on the client (e.g., HTTP-only cookies).
##Status
Approved.

##Next Steps
1. Set up Spring Security with JWT integration.
2. Define roles and permissions in the backend.
3. Implement middleware for role-based access control.
