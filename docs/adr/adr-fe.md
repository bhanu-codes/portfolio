ADR-003: Frontend Framework for Portfolio UI
Context
The user interface of the Portfolio Management System must be dynamic, responsive, and customizable, with a focus on delivering a great user experience.

Decision
The frontend will be developed using ReactJS.

Rationale
Component-Based Architecture: Simplifies development and encourages code reuse.
Dynamic UI: Ideal for rendering dynamic themes and real-time updates.
Large Ecosystem: Rich libraries for state management (Redux/Context API) and UI components (Material-UI, TailwindCSS).
Integration: Works well with RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
Consequences
Positive:
High performance and responsiveness for the UI.
Easy customization for dynamic themes.
Negative:
Requires developers to be familiar with React's lifecycle and state management.
Status
Approved.

Next Steps
Set up a ReactJS project with Create React App or Vite.
Choose and integrate a UI library (e.g., Material-UI).
Develop reusable components for portfolio sections.


ADR-006: Theme Management and Dynamic CSS
Context
The system must support dynamic themes for each portfolio and allow owners to edit themes in real-time.

Decision
Themes will be managed using CSS Variables and persisted in the database.

Rationale
CSS Variables:
Enable runtime theme changes without reloading the page.
Simplifies dynamic styling.
Database Storage:
Each userâ€™s selected theme is stored and applied during login.
Frontend Handling:
Themes will be managed through a global context or state (e.g., Redux).
Consequences
Positive:
Efficient for real-time theme updates.
Simplifies maintenance by centralizing theme logic.
Negative:
Requires careful validation to avoid invalid theme configurations.
Status
Approved.

Next Steps
Define theme schemas in the database.
Implement APIs to fetch and save themes.
Develop a theme editor UI.

ADR-007: Hosting and Deployment
Context
The system must be accessible online with reliable performance and uptime.

Decision
Frontend: Deploy on Vercel or Netlify.
Backend: Deploy on AWS EC2 or Heroku.
Database: Host PostgreSQL on AWS RDS or ElephantSQL.
Rationale
Frontend: Vercel/Netlify provides automatic deployments and CDN distribution.
Backend: AWS EC2 ensures scalability and performance.
Database: AWS RDS offers a managed solution for PostgreSQL.
Consequences
Positive:
Reliable hosting for all components.
Automatic scaling and backups.
Negative:
Slightly higher costs compared to shared hosting.
Status
Approved.

Next Steps
Set up hosting environments for the frontend, backend, and database.
Automate CI/CD pipelines for deployments.
